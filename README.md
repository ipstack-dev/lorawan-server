# Lorawan Server

LoRaWAN server platform, intergating in a single application a Network Server, a Join Server, and an Application Server.

Running the LoRaWAN server is very simple and all you need is:
- the jar files located in the `lib`;
- configure the server.cfg and devices.cfg in the `cfg` folder.

See the following "Server configuration" section for a simple guide on how to set the two configuration files.

Once the server has been correctly configured, you can run it by executing the following command:
```
java -cp lorawan.jar test.server -f cfg/server.cfg
```

More running options are shown in the "Running the server" section.
